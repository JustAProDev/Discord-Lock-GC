# Discord-Lock-GC
What it do :

Basicly you cant Kick or Add anyone in a groupchat ( you dont need gc crown ) . You can add only by 1 way, you need to find it tho x).
Working on an AntiBan,Mute,LockChannel etc ... On servers. But I dont leak it yet. x)

How to use :

Put your token in " yourtokenhere " and launch it ( line 8 )

The Command is " ;lock GroupChatID "
To unlock it " ;unlock GroupChatID "

to take a groupchat id, just right click on the group chat and do " Copy ID " or search on google.

example : " ;lock 982665203420385281 "

It will take 120 seconds to unlock because it rate limit a request.



The rule is simple :

Dont skid ( it's sourcecode because im someone cool so dont skid it )
